      <h2>Teams</h2>
      <p>
        Teams must have a minimum of two students and a maximum of four students.
        <b>Teams must have a faculty sponsor.</b> If your school does not have a faculty sponsor,
        please <a href="mailto:support@hsorectf.tech">email us</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams can be made up of students from different schools as long as all students
	      and faculty sponsors agree.
      </p>
      <h2>Internet Access &amp; Code Generation</h2>
      <p>
        This competition is <b>open-internet</b>. You may use
        the internet for looking up a certain tools documentation or researching attack methods. You may
        <b>not</b> use interactive online services such as chat rooms or forums to communicate with
        anyone during the competition. You may <b>not</b> communicate with anyone outside of your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenges are written specifically for the competition, so looking up the challenges will
        not be useful. We find teams be the most successful when they focus on the challenges and research tools or possible attack methods as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Third party code generation is not allowed.</b>
        Any team that uses any AI/LLMs will be immediately disqualified and their school
        will be ineligible from participating in HSOreCTF in future years. We reserve the right to ask teams to explain the solution
        in detail to judges and revoke credit for solutions if the judges feel the team
        does not provide an adequate explanation.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bringing-own-tech">Bringing Your Own Technology</h2>
      <p>
        In-person teams will be <b>provided a single computer</b> for the competition. Teams may not
        use more than one Mines-provided computer. Teams <b>are allowed to bring and use additional
          computers</b> if they wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the computer provided is often an effective strategy as it allows team members to
        collaborate on solutions rather than having to work on their own.
      </p>
      <h2>In-Person Prizes</h2>
      <p>
        In-person teams can win prizes by placing in the top three. We also
        may award prizes for fun & creative solutions or quick completion of problems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prize for each person in the first place team</li>
        <li>Prize for each person in the second place team</li>
        <li>Prize for each person in the third place team</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rules and prizes are subject to change.</p>
